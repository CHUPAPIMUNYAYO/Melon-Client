Melon Client's download 

A video of how to install Melon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0eh_GfL1Qk  not made by me btw 

Sadly couldn't get beta 1 and 3. If you have it, either add me on discord (bill.#6187) or create a pull request :)))) 

Make sure you have the latest 1.8.9 version of Optifine installed! (1.8.9-M5)
